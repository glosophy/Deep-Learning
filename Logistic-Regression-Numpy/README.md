## Logistic Regression with Numpy

This folder contains two files:
- log-regression.py: Algortihm for the logistic regression model. The model was built using Numpy and contains helper functions for parameters initialization, minimizing cost function, and make predictions (on the test set)
- images.zip: These are the images used in this project. Dowloaded from Kaggle at [https://www.kaggle.com/yo7oyo/lake-plane-binaryclass](https://www.kaggle.com/yo7oyo/lake-plane-binaryclass)
